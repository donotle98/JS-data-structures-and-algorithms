//get the nth fibonacci number
//In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1
// - Input: 12
// - Output: 144

    let fibo = [0, 1];
    if (number <= 2) {
        return 1;
